It's a demo app where people (right now only Sandbox users) can see what Instagram posts have been posted near their area. 

When the user opens the app, the user will see 10 posts from the area. The search will be default to 500 meters around the users current location but the app will allow the user to extend the search radius. 

Also, the app will automatically search a wider area if there are no results found near the user.
